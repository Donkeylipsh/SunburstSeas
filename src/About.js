				<h1>About Sunburst Seas</h1>
				<p>Sunburst Seas is a demo website/functional prototype for my development portfolio. The purpose of this site is to demonstrate my knowledge of React.js and CSS, as well
				as show off some of my personal interests. While this site is a fictional creation today, I hope to someday be able to use this prototype as the foundation (and motivation)
				to setup a breeding tank so I can share all the unique anemones and corals that I've collected over the last 10 years of maintaining reef aquariums.</p>
